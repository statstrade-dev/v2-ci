# Repository guidance

## Responsibility and authority

Greenways CI is the central orchestration repository for exact revisions of
`statstrade-dev/v2`. The active
[`v2-ci.yml`](.github/workflows/v2-ci.yml) workflow is the source of truth for
slice selection and status reporting. Its reusable workflows own backend,
generated-language, frontend, documentation, and Statstrade deployment jobs.
The root [Makefile](Makefile) is the supported dispatch and observation entry
point; [README.md](README.md) describes the current slices.

Read the active workflow files and the two publishing documents under `docs/`
before changing orchestration. The broad diagrams and examples in
`ARCHITECTURE.md` are background context; an active workflow wins if they
differ.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js for the local environment-loader test.
- An authenticated `gh` client with access to this repository and
  `statstrade-dev/v2` for remote runs.
- Docker and GHCR access for backend and language jobs.
- Access to the pinned `zcaudate-xyz/foundation-base` revision for those jobs.
- Protected `statstrade-dev/dot-secrets` and deployment environment access for
  the environment and production workflows.

Do not place `GH_TOKEN`, registry credentials, deployment tokens, or secret
repository contents in this repository or in issue/PR evidence.

## Validation

Focused local validation:

```sh
node --test .github/scripts/load-env-files.test.mjs
```

There is no local V2 application test suite in this repository. The normal
validation is the remote workflow dispatch exposed by the Makefile:

```sh
make run-all
make runs
make watch
```

`make run-all` dispatches `v2-ci.yml` for `statstrade-dev/v2` at `main`;
`make runs` and `make watch` inspect the resulting GitHub Actions run. Slice
focused dispatches are available as `make run-core`, `make run-rpc`,
`make run-gwbuild`, `make run-gwlink`, `make run-js`, `make run-dart`,
`make run-frontend`, and `make run-docs`. These commands require the
dependencies and access listed above and must not be reported as passed from a
local checkout alone. Run `git diff --check` for map changes.

## Generated output and deployment

The V2 source repository owns generated RPC, link, and SQL outputs. Greenways
CI only runs the pinned generators and verifies that tracked output is
unchanged; it does not own those source files. Workflow logs, build artifacts,
release manifests, and deployment outputs are run-scoped derived evidence.
`v2-ci.yml`, `statstrade-environment.yml`, and
`statstrade-production.yml` define the CI and protected deployment boundaries.

## Limits and cleanup

This repository contains orchestration, not the V2 application or its
specifications. A passing loader test proves only allowlist parsing. Full
validation and deployment are access- and environment-gated; production
promotion requires an exact V2 `main` descendant and protected secrets.
Remote runs and artifacts are cleaned up by GitHub retention policy, not by a
local reset command.

For rollout work, follow
[greenways-ai/.github](https://github.com/greenways-ai/.github/blob/main/docs/connector-first-delivery.md),
name `https://github.com/greenways-ai/workspace/issues/30` as the sole Primary
issue, and use `Advances` for workspace issue #26.
